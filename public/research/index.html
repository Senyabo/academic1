Tiny islands have turned into major flashpoints threatening regional peace, stability, and cooperation. This research describes China’s maritime territorial disputes in East and South China Seas, examines the impact of the ongoing disputes on regional security and cooperation, evaluates the role of China in the region regarding disputes, and explores the possibility for potential military conflict. Furthermore, the book analyses the role of the US and its interest, and evaluates possible ways for peaceful conflict mitigation and resolution. The investigation concludes that China’s maritime territorial disputes have destabilizing impact on security and negative impact on international cooperation. The book suggests that China will manage to influence further the region in its favour, similarly to Rome’s influence in the Mediterranean and the US’s in the Caribbean seas.

Still, alliances that foster preference convergence, particularly when such convergence is privately accepted,are more resilient and harder to undermine. The influence of intra-alliance socialization on preference alignment and alliance cohesion, however, remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how different levels of socialization shape cohesion in asymmetric alliances. The analysis compares the formal South Korea – US alliance (marked by a relatively higher degree of socialization) with the informal Taiwan – US alliance (with relatively lower degree of socialization). The findings indicate that robust socialization mechanisms,such as military training, joint exercises, and policy coordination, promote greater internalization of US preferences and strengthen alliance cohesion. However, these effects are often constrained by factors such as power asymmetries, divergent threat perceptions, adversarial influence, domestic politics, media control, and historical mistrust. By highlighting the conditional effects of socialization on alliance stability, this study contributes to the constructivist – rationalist debate and advances the conversation on asymmetric security alliances. Kostadinov, Yavor A. 2025 The Price of Virality and the Imperative for (Self) Regulation of Child Social Media Influencers in Taiwan Social Media + Society (Q1 SSCI, IF 6.8) DOI Abstract This paper explores the increasing prevalence of child social media influencers in Taiwan. It appears that their motivations extend beyond popularity and mere financial incentives to include opportunities for self-expression, the development of communication abilities, and the acquisition of audio-visual development skills. However, the article underscores critical concerns regarding the well-being of child influencers. These concerns stem from unique dilemmas related to child labor, privacy, and parental control, including potential impediments to holistic development, popularity-related bullying, emotional and psychological vulnerabilities to performance pressure and feedback, and the possibility of exploitation arising from unregulated monetization. The analysis reveals the inadequacies of existing Taiwanese legal frameworks in effectively addressing the unique concerns and vulnerabilities of child influencers. Despite legislative and media discourse, socio-political challenges persist. Public and cultural disagreements on child online rights and parental control, with regulatory duty disputes, hinder comprehensive protection for Taiwan’s child influencers. Kostadinov, Yavor A.; Chow, W. Emily 2025 Digital Media Trends in Public Diplomacy: the Case of Taiwan’s Youth Ambassadors The Hague Journal of Diplomacy (Q2, IF 1.9) DOI Abstract Digital media facilitate global reach and empower individuals as cultural influencers. Taiwanese youth ambassadors (YA s) can tell Taiwan’s story online to boost its credibility and attract attention. This article explores the role of these non-state actors as potential social media influencers in cultural diplomacy. Findings from a survey and focus group in the International Youth Ambassador Exchange Programme indicate that YA s reject the role of social media influencers. YA s view social media as inadequate for trust building and credibility compared with interpersonal interactions. While some YA s see social media as a cross-cultural bridge, others view it as contentious, particularly around Taiwan’s political status. To avoid controversy, YA s focus on positive image building and cultural promotion. Ultimately, some of their efforts aim to enhance Taiwan’s global awareness and cultivate collective pride among Taiwanese youth. This case contributes to understanding the digital role and experience of non-state diplomatic actors from state-affiliated cultural diplomacy programmes.

Samuel Ku & Kristina Kironska, World Scientific Publishing, pp. 99–146. DOI: 10.1142/9789813141674_0005 Link Abstract There is an undisputed increase in the importance of migration over the past two decades in general, and in migration of workers in Asia in particular, partially as an effect of an increasingly globalized world. However, existing research seldom investigates the comparative conditions in host countries for migrant workers, and the impact of migrant workers on the socio-politico-economic environment in those countries. It could be argued that this is so, mainly due to the traditional view that as a poor minority, migrant workers do not have enough significant power to influence the conditions they live under and the respective social policies governing them. Therefore, this study explores the interaction between migrant workers and their environment by comparing the conditions for migrant workers in the four Asian tigers — Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan — and by investigating related influences and changes, if any, in those states’ migration policies. The outcomes of this study aim to confirm the emphasis on the growing importance of migration workers and their influence in shaping the socio-politico-economic environment and policies in host countries with a focus in detail on the perceived advantages and disadvantages of migration, drawing on phenomena such as the uprising of migrant workers in Singapore in 2013, frequent “revolts of the housekeeper” in Hong Kong, and recent protests of migrant workers in South Korea and Taiwan. Finally, the research recognizes the divide between developing and developed countries, the lack of an international safeguarding mechanism, and the issue of the level of access to labor unions and labor markets. The study is designed to provide a comparative picture of the working and living conditions in the four Asian tigers, and a better understanding of the role of migrant workers in relation to policy in a rapidly changing and modernizing world.
