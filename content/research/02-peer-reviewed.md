         Great powers are often assumed to resort to divide et impera strategies to manage asymmetric alliances. Still, alliances that foster preference convergence, particularly when such convergence is privately accepted,are more resilient and harder to undermine. The influence of intra-alliance socialization on preference alignment and alliance cohesion, however, remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how different levels of socialization shape cohesion in asymmetric alliances. The analysis compares the formal South Korea – US alliance (marked by a relatively higher degree of socialization) with the informal Taiwan – US alliance (with relatively lower degree of socialization). The findings indicate that robust socialization mechanisms,such as military training, joint exercises, and policy coordination, promote greater internalization of US preferences and strengthen alliance cohesion. However, these effects are often constrained by factors such as power asymmetries, divergent threat perceptions, adversarial influence, domestic politics, media control, and historical mistrust. By highlighting the conditional effects of socialization on alliance stability, this study contributes to the constructivist – rationalist debate and advances the conversation on asymmetric security alliances.

          This paper explores the increasing prevalence of child social media influencers in Taiwan. It appears that their motivations extend beyond popularity and mere financial incentives to include opportunities for self-expression, the development of communication abilities, and the acquisition of audio-visual development skills. However, the article underscores critical concerns regarding the well-being of child influencers. These concerns stem from unique dilemmas related to child labor, privacy, and parental control, including potential impediments to holistic development, popularity-related bullying, emotional and psychological vulnerabilities to performance pressure and feedback, and the possibility of exploitation arising from unregulated monetization. The analysis reveals the inadequacies of existing Taiwanese legal frameworks in effectively addressing the unique concerns and vulnerabilities of child influencers. Despite legislative and media discourse, socio-political challenges persist. Public and cultural disagreements on child online rights and parental control, with regulatory duty disputes, hinder comprehensive protection for Taiwan’s child influencers.

          Digital media facilitate global reach and empower individuals as cultural influencers. Taiwanese youth ambassadors (YA s) can tell Taiwan’s story online to boost its credibility and attract attention. This article explores the role of these non-state actors as potential social media influencers in cultural diplomacy. Findings from a survey and focus group in the International Youth Ambassador Exchange Programme indicate that YA s reject the role of social media influencers. YA s view social media as inadequate for trust building and credibility compared with interpersonal interactions. While some YA s see social media as a cross-cultural bridge, others view it as contentious, particularly around Taiwan’s political status. To avoid controversy, YA s focus on positive image building and cultural promotion. Ultimately, some of their efforts aim to enhance Taiwan’s global awareness and cultivate collective pride among Taiwanese youth. This case contributes to understanding the digital role and experience of non-state diplomatic actors from state-affiliated cultural diplomacy programmes.
